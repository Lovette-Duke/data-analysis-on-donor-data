This is and exploratory data analysis done on a hypothetical Donor dataset.

Findings and Recommendations 
The following insights can be drawn from the analysis and visualizations:
1.	The top 5 states with the highest amount of donations made also had the highest number of donors.
2.	The top 5 weekly donors are all located in the top 3 states with the highest donations.
3.	While certain professions made more donations the difference between the top 5 professions and the bottom 5 donations are not very significant.
The 2 major ways to increase the donation value would be to: 
1.	Encourage the current donors to increase the frequency of their donations and especially top monthly, yearly and one-off donors and
2.	To encourage more people to become donors preferably in the top 5 states where they are more likely to donate and become donors.


Conclusion
I concluded that focusing fundraising efforts in the top 5 state with the highest donations could potentially give us the best result in terms of increasing the donation value.
